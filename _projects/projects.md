- Worked under the guidance of Prof. Andrew Schwartz and Adithya Ganesan of the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University to fine-tune masked language modeling(MLM) with RoBERTa, BERTweet as seed to capture the language used in social media for token and sequence classification tasks. <br><br>

## __Real-time Vehicle Detection and Classification in Aerial Scenes [Oct '17 - Mar '18]__ ***

<p class="full-width"><img src="/public/pic006.jpg" style="width:36rem;height:20rem" align="left"/></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

- Identified the shortcomings of the existing one-stage object detectors for aerial scenes. To address their shortcomings, proposed a modified Convolutional Neural Network by introducing ConvRes blocks at multiple scales to preserve salient features of small-sized objects such as cars, trucks, planes, boats, and heavy vehicles in satellite and drone imagery using Darknet framework and CUDA.
- Generated a new data set by collecting aerial images from open sources and demonstrated the efficacy of the model by conducting experiments on three challenging data sets VEDAI, DLR-3K, and DOTA. 
- Benchmarked performance against the existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of mAP, computational and space complexity.
- Above image is model's sample prediction in aerial view.

 - Implemented Prod2Vec model which uses the local product co-occurrence information established by the product sequences to create a distributed representation of products and recommends similar products. 
 - Performed comparative analysis of GloVe, FastText and Word2Vec models on retail product embeddings.
 - Above image is model's product embeddings visualised for one product and its neighbors in Tensorflow Embedding Projector. <br><br>

 - Finetuned ImageNet pre-trained Resnet50 CNN model to serve as a feature extractor and using it performed classification task on JPL interaction video frames to identify activities such as hugging, waving, punching etc. in PyTorch and OpenCV. 
 - Temporal pooling was used to extract spatial features in a given time window. <br><br>

 - Built a fair price prediction model for Airbnb listings using range of methods like support vector regression, random forest regression and gradient boosting models. 
 - Performed multi-class customer review sentiment analysis using pretrained word embeddings and bidirectional LSTM model using Tensorflow with training dataset consisting of 10+ million customer reviews. <br><br>
