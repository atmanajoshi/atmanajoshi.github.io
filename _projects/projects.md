- __Retrieval Patterns of Physical Objects from Retail Sales__ <br>
Implemented Prod2Vec algorithm which uses the local product co-occurrence information established by the product sequences to create a distributed representation of products and recommends similar products. Performed comparative analysis of GloVe, FastText and Word2Vec models on retail product embeddings. <br>

- __First-Person Activity Recognition in Videos__ <br>
Finetuned ImageNet pre-trained Resnet50 CNN model to serve as a feature extractor and using it performed classification task on JPL interaction video frames to identify activities such as hugging, waving, punching etc. in PyTorch and OpenCV. Temporal pooling was used to extract spatial features in a given time window. <br>

- __Airbnb Price Prediction and Sentiment Analysis__ <br>
Built a fair price prediction model for Airbnb listings using range of methods like support vector regression, random forest regression and gradient boosting models. Performed customer review sentiment analysis using pretrained word embeddings and bidirectional LSTM model using Tensorflow. <br>

- __Aerial Vehicle Detection and Classification__ <br>
Designed and developed an aerial vehicle detector using convolutional neural network for recognition of planes, boats, and heavy vehicles in satellite and drone imagery using Darknet framework and CUDA. <br>
