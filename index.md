I have earned Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, with a solid academic background in informatics from Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis. My diverse educational journey has equipped me with skills in machine learning, data science, clinical information systems, and human-computer interaction. 

I have pursued my MS Thesis and research at [Gu Lab, Center for Comutational Psychiatry](https://www.neurocpu.org/) under the guidance of [Dr. Xiaosi Gu](https://profiles.icahn.mssm.edu/xiaosi-gu?pk_vid=b3874027cb494c101721417624946926) and postdoc mentors [Dr. Shawn Rhoads](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=__YmDVEAAAAJ) and [Dr. Blair Shevlin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J_t6LicAAAAJ&hl=en). 

During my undergraduate studies, I served as an undergraduate Research Assistant for three years in the [Dean’s Office of Research in Medical Education](https://medicine.iu.edu/blogs/research-in-medical-education/introduction-research-medical-education-unit) at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Under the mentorship of [Dr. Komal Kochhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jkkjFzIAAAAJ&hl=en), I conducted both qualitative and quantitative research to analyze factors influencing physician workforce distribution and healthcare access in Indiana. My work included statistical analysis for residency and fellowship evaluation projects, creating reports that informed strategies to address physician shortages and mal-distribution. 

Prior to my masters, I served as a Data Analyst at the Regenstrief Institute, collaborating closely with physicians and researchers to fulfill their data requirements for various studies. I leveraged SQL, SAS, and R for data extraction and analysis, ensuring precise patient cohort identification while maintaining data privacy as per HIPAA and IRB protocols. Previously, as a Clinical Informatics Specialist at Oak Street Health, I meticulously documented patient encounters and supported multidisciplinary care teams in geriatrics and primary care setting. 

I am passionate about leveraging technology to address healthcare challenges, as demonstrated by my diverse [project](https://atmanajoshi.github.io/Projects) experience. My technical proficiency spans programming languages such as Python, SQL, and R, and I am experienced in using various software tools for data analysis and visualization.

Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I am an Indian classical dancer, performing and studying Bharatanatyam since 2016. I have actively volunteered in various community services, contributing to healthcare and educational initiatives.
