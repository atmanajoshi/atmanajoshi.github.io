I am a Master of Science graduate in Biomedical Sciences from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, with a solid academic background in informatics from Indiana University â€“ Purdue University Indianapolis. My diverse educational journey has equipped me with skills in machine learning, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and human-computer interaction. 

I have pursued my MS Thesis and research at [Gu Lab, Center for Comutational Psychiatry](https://www.neurocpu.org/) under the guidance of [Dr. Xiaosi Gu](https://profiles.icahn.mssm.edu/xiaosi-gu?pk_vid=b3874027cb494c101721417624946926) and postdoc mentors Dr. Shawn Rhoads and Dr. Blair Shevlin. 

During my bachelor's, I conducted research in computer vision focused on real-time object detection and recognition in aerial scenary. I co-authored journal publication which was later published in [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8755462){:target="_blank"} and I presented my published work at [IEEE International Conference on Image Processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8803262){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are human-centered Natural Language Processing applications, vision-based object/action detection, recognition and tracking in images/videos.

Prior to my masters, I gained 3 years of experience working as a software engineer at JP Morgan Chase & Co. in Mumbai, India. From developing and maintaining various financial applications, I have gained experience in end to end Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and CI/CD pipelines.
